# ARFs_for_Shapley_Vals

A method under development that uses trained ARFs (Adversarial Random Forests) to calculate conditional shapley values. 
Built on top of the shapr package. 

To initialise the required functions from shapr in the correct fashion, run through the steps in init.R
An example of ARFs for shapley values using sythetic data is also contained in init.R
For explanation on how the method works, see VectorisedMAP.R
